# Hotspot-Analysis
 We will visualize the results of hotspot analysis and use kernel density estimation, which is the most popular algorithm for building distributions using a collection of observations. By the end of the course, you should be able to leverage Python libraries to build multi-dimensional density estimation models and work with geo-spatial data.
